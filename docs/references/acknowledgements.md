## AI Assistance & Research Tools

**Artificial Intelligence Tools Used:**

This project leveraged AI-powered research and development tools to accelerate information synthesis, schema design, and documentation development (November 2025 – January 2026):

### Claude (Anthropic)
- **Primary Use:** Framework development, refinement, documentation, and technical architecture
- **Time Period:** November 2025 – January 2026
- **Specific Applications:*

    - **Framework Development & Refinement:** Helped evolve RGDS from v1.0 through v1.4 during the Thanksgiving 2025 development sprint; assisted in articulating the core principle of "non-agentic AI governance" where humans retain decision authority while AI provides evidence structuring; contributed to defining RGDS as a decision-centric framework rather than a process automation tool
    - **Decision Log Schema System:** Drafted and iterated the decision-log.schema.json with semantic invariants; produced and maintained example decision logs (RGDS-DEC-0001 through RGDS-DEC-0006) aligned to the schema; supported validation workflows and schema refinement decisions
    - **Whitepaper Authoring & Structure:** Generated submission-style RGDS research write-ups designed for academic presentation; conducted multi-pass formatting normalization across whitepaper content for MkDocs rendering (bullet/list normalization, punctuation consistency, citation formatting)
    - **Citation System & Bibliography Integrity:** Implemented and validated clickable bracket citations in MkDocs; conducted citation audit passes for high-risk claims; merged and ported acknowledgements, document version updates, and reference usage content into correct locations; triaged specific line-item citation fixes
    - **Technical Architecture:** Participated in creating technical architecture diagrams; helped articulate how RGDS addresses observed failure modes in regulated delivery environments; supported documentation of framework application in regulated biopharma contexts
    - **Documentation & Publishing:** Resolving citation and bibliography challenges for the RGDS whitepaper; supporting GitHub Pages Jekyll setup for academic credibility; assisting with MkDocs documentation systems development
    - **Communication & Positioning:** Translating complex AI governance concepts into accessible formats for different stakeholder audiences; supporting job application materials that position RGDS as demonstrable expertise; contributing to professional positioning that makes the research "interrogable, not narrated"
    - **Repository Packaging & Delivery:** Produced downloadable bundles and handled artifact delivery paths; walked through terminal-based MkDocs viewing and debug steps; provided exact license notice blocks for repository presentation

### Perplexity AI (Deep Research Mode)
- **Primary Use:** Comprehensive literature synthesis and regulatory intelligence gathering
- **Time Period:** November 2025 – January 2026
- **Specific Applications:**

    - **Regulatory Intelligence:** Deep research on FDA guidance documents, international regulatory frameworks (WHO, EMA, ICH), and emerging policy trajectories; identified FDA's January 2025 draft guidance on AI-supported regulatory decision-making as foundational for RGDS governance thinking
    - **Industry Analysis:** Synthesis of biopharmaceutical industry trends, portfolio management methodologies, governance best practices, and competitive positioning; aggregated insights from consulting firms (McKinsey, Deloitte, Lumanity) and asset valuation methodologies
    - **Academic Research:** Literature review of decision frameworks, AI governance standards, regulatory science publications, and change management literature; identified key thought leaders and foundational frameworks across decision architecture, financial analysis, and compliance infrastructure
    - **Citation Discovery & Bibliography Building:** Identified and verified authoritative sources across regulatory agencies, consulting firms, academic institutions, and professional organizations; built and maintained the comprehensive 96-entry bibliography with direct source verification
    - **Multi-Source Synthesis:** Aggregated insights from regulatory guidance, industry reports, academic research, and professional standards to build the evidence base for RGDS positioning and value propositions
    - **MkDocs & Licensing Research:** Deep research on MkDocs best practices, Material theme customization, open-source licensing requirements (MIT vs. Apache 2.0, BSD-2-Clause attribution), and documentation attribution standards; identified license compatibility issues and JSON schema copyright thresholds
    - **Domain-Specific Research:** Conducted focused research on AI in clinical trials, AI in software as medical devices (SaMD), AI readiness assessment frameworks, and regulatory science policy trajectories

### ChatGPT (OpenAI, GPT-5.2 + Agent Mode + Deep Research Mode)
- **Time Period:** December 2025 – January 2026
- **Specific Applications:**

    - **JSON Schema Development:** Initial JSON schema structures for decision logs and governance covenants, subsequently validated and refined against real-world regulatory scenarios
    - **Python Code Examples:** Generated implementation examples for RGDS framework usage; provided code snippets for validation workflows and schema testing
    - **Documentation Drafting:** Initial content development and technical writing assistance for framework documentation
    - **Conceptualization & Brainstorming:** Brainstorming organization structures for complex regulatory concepts; identifying documentation edge cases and potential user confusion points
    - **Writing & Editing:** Grammar suggestions and technical clarity improvements for regulatory and governance terminology

**Human Oversight & Validation:**

All AI-generated content was critically reviewed and validated:


- Regulatory citations verified against original FDA guidance documents and agency sources
- Industry analyses cross-checked with primary publications from consulting firms and academic institutions
- Technical implementations (schemas, code examples) tested against real-world use cases
- Financial calculations verified using established methodologies
- All 96 bibliography entries confirmed for accuracy, accessibility, and direct source verification
- Framework positioning validated against regulatory precedent and industry standards
- Documentation structure and citation integrity audited for consistency and accuracy

This framework represents independent research and analysis developed for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes. It synthesizes publicly available information and should not be construed as regulatory, legal, or professional advice. Organizations considering RGDS adoption should conduct their own validation and consult with qualified regulatory affairs, legal, and compliance professionals.

## Regulatory Leadership & Vision

**U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA):**

The FDA's January 2025 draft guidance on *Considerations for the Use of Artificial Intelligence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for Drug and Biological Products* [\[10\]](/references/bibliography/#cite10) provided the foundational regulatory scaffolding for RGDS decision governance thinking. This guidance introduced a seven-step framework for assessing AI model credibility [\[46\]](/references/bibliography/#cite46)[\[47\]](/references/bibliography/#cite47)[\[48\]](/references/bibliography/#cite48)[\[51\]](/references/bibliography/#cite51)[\[52\]](/references/bibliography/#cite52), which directly informed RGDS's emphasis on decision defensibility and reconstructability.

Recognition of decision reconstructability challenges in FDA Form 483 observations [\[38\]](/references/bibliography/#cite38) helped crystallize the core RGDS thesis: that regulatory deficiencies often stem not from scientific capability, but from ambiguous decision rationale and incomplete evidence documentation.

The FDA's support for early regulatory engagement on novel governance frameworks signaled openness to non-traditional approaches to AI accountability in drug development.

**International Regulatory Organizations:**

- **WHO:** 2024 ethical guidelines on AI transparency, accessibility, validation, and monitoring informed RGDS's emphasis on explicit governance boundaries and human oversight
- **EMA:** 2024 pharmacovigilance AI integration guidance on transparency and governance provided international context for decision discipline
- **ICH:** Ongoing harmonization efforts informed RGDS's positioning for global applicability across regulated phase-gate environments

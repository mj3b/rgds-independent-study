## About This Work

This framework was developed as an independent research project (November 2025 – January 2026) investigating decision governance in regulated biopharmaceutical environments. It synthesizes publicly available regulatory guidance, academic literature, industry analysis, and professional standards to propose a structured approach to decision documentation in phase-gated drug development.

The work is released as an open-source research framework under the Apache License 2.0. While it references Syner-G BioPharma Group's contributions to regulatory science, it was created without organizational affiliation or sponsorship.

## Acknowledgements

I am grateful to the regulatory agencies, academic centers, professional societies, and industry practitioners whose published work shaped the conceptual foundations of this project.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's January 2025 draft guidance on artificial intelligence in regulatory decision-making [\[10\]](bibliography.md#cite10) and its seven-step credibility assessment framework [\[46\]](bibliography.md#cite46)[\[47\]](bibliography.md#cite47)[\[48\]](bibliography.md#cite48) provided the principal regulatory scaffold for the RGDS model. Recognition of decision reconstructability challenges in FDA Form 483 observations [\[38\]](bibliography.md#cite38) helped crystallize the core thesis: that regulatory deficiencies often stem not from scientific capability but from ambiguous decision rationale and incomplete evidence documentation. International guidance from the WHO, EMA, and ICH on AI transparency, pharmacovigilance governance, and regulatory harmonization informed the framework's positioning for global applicability.

I also acknowledge the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development [\[35\]](bibliography.md#cite35), the Duke-Margolis Institute for Health Policy, MIT Sloan Executive Education, the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society [\[71\]](bibliography.md#cite71), FDLI [\[49\]](bibliography.md#cite49), ISPE [\[14\]](bibliography.md#cite14), and industry analysts at Lumanity, McKinsey, Deloitte [\[56\]](bibliography.md#cite56)[\[78\]](bibliography.md#cite78), Analysis Group [\[25\]](bibliography.md#cite25)[\[77\]](bibliography.md#cite77), and Certara [\[6\]](bibliography.md#cite6)[\[59\]](bibliography.md#cite59), whose research and analyses informed the evidence base, ROI modeling, and regulatory strategy discussions throughout this work. The decision architecture draws on established frameworks including RACI/DACI [\[16\]](bibliography.md#cite16)[\[17\]](bibliography.md#cite17), Critical Path Method [\[18\]](bibliography.md#cite18), and portfolio management methodologies [\[22\]](bibliography.md#cite22)[\[79\]](bibliography.md#cite79)[\[83\]](bibliography.md#cite83), as well as FDA work on explainability and interpretability [\[10\]](bibliography.md#cite10)[\[46\]](bibliography.md#cite46)[\[48\]](bibliography.md#cite48)[\[69\]](bibliography.md#cite69) and quality management maturity [\[39\]](bibliography.md#cite39).

## AI-Assisted Research Disclosure

In developing this project, I used AI-enabled tools—including large language models and web-based research platforms—to assist with literature discovery, evidence synthesis, schema design, drafting, and editing (November 2025 – January 2026). These tools supported organization, speed, and clarity but did not replace human judgment. I remain solely responsible for the selection, interpretation, and integration of all sources. All regulatory citations were verified against original agency documents, industry analyses were cross-checked with primary publications, technical implementations were tested against real-world use cases, and all 96 bibliography entries were confirmed for accuracy and accessibility.

AI tools were not listed as authors or co-authors, consistent with ICMJE recommendations on AI-assisted technology in scholarly work. A detailed description of research tooling, AI-assisted workflows, and validation procedures is available in the [Supplementary Materials and Technical Notes](methods-and-tools/).

## Research Integrity

This work synthesizes publicly available research, regulatory guidance, industry analysis, and professional best practices. All direct citations reference the [complete bibliography](bibliography/), entries [1–96], with attribution provided throughout the framework.

Where RGDS extends or reinterprets existing frameworks—for example, adapting FDA's seven-step credibility framework for decision-governance purposes—the extension is explicitly noted and the original source is cited. Financial analysis methodology and ROI modeling details are documented in [Appendix A](appendix-a/).

The goal is transparency: readers should be able to trace claims back to their sources and form their own judgments about the strength of evidence.

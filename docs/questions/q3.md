# Research Question 3

## 3. How can decision governance frameworks integrate with existing biopharma/biotech project management practices without adding bureaucratic overhead?

### Answer in brief

Biopharma/biotech organizations already run mature project management practices—RACI matrices, Critical Path Method, Target Product Profiles, multi-tier QA workflows—but these frameworks operate in isolation and fail to bridge the gap between process discipline and decision clarity. Teams spend weeks debating "Are we ready?" at phase gates without a shared vocabulary for risk tolerance, evidence completeness, or contingency planning, leading to rework, re-litigation of decisions at later gates, and 15–20 hours of wasted executive time per major decision.

RGDS does not add bureaucratic overhead; instead, it **consolidates fragmented practices into a single, schema-validated decision record** that simultaneously serves as RACI implementer (who approved), evidence summarizer (what data informed the choice), risk articulator (what risk posture we chose), and quality gate enforcer (is the decision complete enough to move forward?). In practice, this replaces recurring 4-week status-meeting cycles with a single 3–6-hour decision-log authoring session that, once approved, prevents stakeholder re-litigation and eliminates the need for parallel risk registers and change-control meetings. RGDS integration works because it **respects how teams actually work**—it does not force new tools, only standardized documentation of decisions they are already making.

### The Integration Challenge

Biopharma/biotech organizations operate with mature project management disciplines refined over decades. Most companies use **RACI matrices** (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) to clarify decision authority<a href="/references/bibliography/#cite16">[16]</a> <a href="/references/bibliography/#cite17">[17]</a>, **Critical Path Method (CPM)** to identify timeline constraints<a href="/references/bibliography/#cite18">[18]</a>, **Target Product Profiles (TPP)** to align development strategy with product vision<a href="/references/bibliography/#cite21">[21]</a> <a href="/references/bibliography/#cite22">[22]</a> <a href="/references/bibliography/#cite23">[23]</a>, and **multi-tiered quality assurance** (author → peer review → QC specialist → functional lead → cross-functional red team) to ensure documentation quality<a href="/references/bibliography/#cite15">[15]</a> <a href="/references/bibliography/#cite19">[19]</a> <a href="/references/bibliography/#cite20">[20]</a>. These frameworks have proven effective at **coordination**—reducing vendor delays, preventing scope creep, accelerating approvals—and organizations reasonably worry that **adding decision governance on top** of existing practices will create duplicative bureaucratic overhead<a href="/references/bibliography/#cite13">[13]</a> <a href="/references/bibliography/#cite15">[15]</a>.

Common objection from biopharma/biotech teams: **"We're already buried in project management artifacts. RACI matrices, Gantt charts, status reports, risk registers, issue logs, change control boards, quality gates. Adding decision logs will slow us down, not speed us up."**<a href="/references/bibliography/#cite13">[13]</a>

This objection reflects a **fundamental misunderstanding** of RGDS's value proposition: Decision governance is **not additive bureaucracy** but **streamlined consolidation** of existing decision practices. Currently, decision-making happens **informally and in parallel**:

- **RACI matrix:** Clarifies "who is accountable," but not "what evidence supported the decision"
- **Status reports:** Document progress ("On track"), not decision logic ("Why did we choose Path A over Path B?")
- **Change control board:** Approves scope changes ("Approved: Add hepatic clearance study"), but doesn't document risk tolerance ("Why did we accept the timeline impact?")
- **Risk register:** Tracks identified risks, but doesn't connect risks to decisions ("Did we document that we accepted risk R-023?")
- **Quality gates:** Determine "Ready to proceed?" but debate the decision for 2–4 weeks without explicit framework<a href="/references/bibliography/#cite13">[13]</a> <a href="/references/bibliography/#cite16">[16]</a>

RGDS **consolidates these fragmented practices** into a single, schema-validated decision record that simultaneously:

1. **Documents decision authority** (RACI matrix function: who approved)
2. **Records evidence base** (status reporting function: what data informed decision)
3. **Articulates risk posture** (risk register function: what risks were accepted)
4. **Imposes quality standards** (quality gate function: decision completeness requirements)

The net effect: **Eliminate recurring "Are we ready?" debates** (2–4 weeks saved) + **Provide instant FDA reconstructability** (2–3 weeks saved) = **Net timeline acceleration despite 30–60 minutes per decision log authoring**<a href="/references/bibliography/#cite13">[13]</a> <a href="/references/bibliography/#cite15">[15]</a>.

### Five Integration Patterns with Existing Practices

Below are five specific examples of how RGDS integrates with mature biopharma/biotech project management frameworks, **replacing redundant practices rather than adding overhead**.

#### Integration Pattern 1: RACI Matrix → Decision Owner/Approvers in Decision Log

**Traditional RACI Practice:**

A 15×15 RACI matrix documents which stakeholders are Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, or Informed for 200+ activities across 15 functions (Nonclinical, Clinical, CMC, Regulatory, Medical Writing, Quality, Finance, Program Management, etc.). Updated quarterly. Three pages long.

Problem: RACI clarifies **who makes decisions** (accountable person), but when disputes arise months later ("Why did we proceed with incomplete data?"), the RACI matrix doesn't answer **why the accountable person decided to proceed**.

**RGDS Integration:**

Decision log **`decisionowner` and `approvers` fields** replace RACI's "Accountable" designation. Example:

> Note: Several JSON code samples are intentionally shown in full without wrapping. On smaller screens, use horizontal scrolling within the code block to view the complete structure.

```json
{
  "decisionid": "RGDS-DEC-IND2026-2026-003",
  "decisiontitle": "Conditional-Go: Proceed with IND CMC Section with Staged Stability Data",
  "decisionquestion": "Is CMC data package sufficiently complete to support IND submission, accepting staged stability data for post-IND backfill?",

  "decisionowner": "VP Regulatory Affairs (Name: Sarah Chen)",
  "approvers": [
    {
      "name": "CMC Technical Lead (Name: Dr. James Rodriguez)",
      "role": "Subject matter expert validation",
      "approvaldate": "2026-01-12T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "name": "Quality Assurance Manager (Name: Patricia Müller)",
      "role": "QA gate approval",
      "approvaldate": "2026-01-12T11:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "name": "Program Director (Name: Michael Okonkwo)",
      "role": "Executive sponsor",
      "approvaldate": "2026-01-12T14:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**RACI replacement value:**  
No need to maintain a separate 15×15 RACI matrix. Decision logs **are** the RACI implementation—one record per decision, showing exactly who was accountable and what evidence they used to decide.

**Integration benefit:**  
3–5 hours saved per quarter (RACI matrix maintenance eliminated). Decision accountability is preserved and enhanced, because it now includes the evidence base, not just authority.

---

#### Integration Pattern 2: Critical Path Method + Risk Register → Decision Conditional-Go in Decision Log

**Traditional CPM + Risk Register Practice:**

Critical Path Method identifies the longest-duration constraint chain (e.g., “GLP tox study 26 weeks → report generation 2 weeks → IND authoring 6 weeks → FDA review 30 days → Phase I startup = 36-week critical path”).  
The risk register identifies risks blocking that path (e.g., “Risk R-023: CRO delay on tox study completion; probability 30%; impact if occurs: 4-week delay; mitigation: weekly CRO calls + backup study site identified”).

**Problem:**

CPM and the risk register exist as **independent documents**. When CRO delays occur, teams debate:

> “Do we defer IND submission (protecting against risk R-023 materialization) or proceed with the audit report (accepting risk R-023)?”

The decision is made verbally. The risk register is later updated to:  
“Risk R-023: Materialized; accepted; proceeding with audit report.”

What’s missing is the rationale: **why the risk was accepted**, under what conditions, and with what contingency.

**RGDS Integration:**

The decision log **`conditions` field** (a conditional-go outcome) closes the CPM/risk-register gap by explicitly documenting risk acceptance, mitigation, and contingency in the decision record itself.

> **Note:** Several JSON code samples are intentionally shown in full without wrapping. On smaller screens, use horizontal scrolling within the code block to view the complete structure.

```json
{
  "decisionid": "RGDS-DEC-IND2026-2026-001",
  "decisionquestion": "Is nonclinical data package sufficiently complete to begin IND authoring, accepting explicit conditions for final tox data backfill?",
  
  "decisionoutcome": "conditionalgo",
  
  "conditions": [
    {
      "conditionid": "C-001",
      "conditiontext": "Obtain final GLP tox report for Study-03 and backfill M2.6.7 toxicology summary section",
      "owner": "CRO Study Monitor + Principal AI Business Analyst",
      "duedate": "2026-01-20",
      "criticality": "high",
      "linkedrisk": "R-023 (CRO delay on tox study)",
      "riskmitigation": "Weekly CRO calls (every Tuesday 10 AM); escalation to Certara VP Operations if delay forecast >3 days",
      "contingency": "If final report not received by 2026-01-20, activate backup CRO (identified Q3 2025; can generate report by 2026-01-27; adds 7 days to IND submission)"
    }
  ],
  
  "riskposture": "risk-accepting on timeline; risk-minimizing on data quality"
}
```

**CPM/Risk Register replacement value:**  
The **`conditions`** field connects CPM critical path decisions to the risk register by making risk acceptance explicit inside the decision record: **which risks were accepted**, **what mitigation exists**, and **what contingency activates if the risk materializes**. One decision log replaces hours of CPM/risk-register debate.

**Integration benefit:**  
Eliminates ad-hoc risk acceptance discussions. The decision log enforces a simple standard: when you accept risk, you document **why you accepted it**, **what reduces probability**, and **what activates if it materializes**. This cuts recurring “Are we ready?” debates from 2–4 weeks down to a single decision-log authoring window (about 2–3 hours).

---

#### Integration Pattern 3: Target Product Profile (TPP) → Decision Evidence Base in Decision Log

**Traditional TPP Practice:**

A Target Product Profile captures product intent: indication, target population, efficacy claim, safety profile, manufacturing approach, and commercial positioning. It drives development strategy, but it’s typically **static** (created early, revised quarterly) and written at a **strategy level** (program vision, not individual decisions).

**Problem:**

Teams make tactical calls—“Do we run additional tox?” “Do we proceed with CMC strategy A or B?”—without explicitly tying the decision back to the TPP. That weak link causes:

- **Scope creep** (extra studies that don’t advance the TPP)
- **Insufficient preparation** (deferring work that later blocks the intended profile)

**RGDS Integration:**

The decision log’s **`evidence`** field includes an explicit TPP reference whenever the TPP supports or constrains the decision. That keeps tactical choices aligned to strategic intent and makes the rationale reconstructable.

> **Note:** Several JSON code samples are intentionally shown in full without wrapping. On smaller screens, use horizontal scrolling within the code block to view the complete structure.

```json
{
  "decisionid": "RGDS-DEC-IND2026-2026-002",
  "decisionquestion": "Should we conduct a specialized toxicology study for hepatic metabolite assessment, or defer to post-IND phase?",
  
  "options": [
    {
      "optionid": "OPT-A",
      "optiontext": "Conduct hepatic metabolite study pre-IND (8-week delay to critical path)",
      "rejected": true,
      "rejectionreason": "TPP specifies Phase I dose escalation to 300 mg/day; hepatic metabolite study only warranted if Phase I reveals unexpected elevation of liver enzymes or metabolite accumulation (>2-fold per FDA guidance). Deferring study to post-IND phase aligns with TPP strategy (adaptive development based on emerging Phase I data) and accelerates IND submission by 8 weeks."
    },
    {
      "optionid": "OPT-B",
      "optiontext": "Defer hepatic metabolite study to post-IND; proceed with Phase I",
      "selected": true,
      "selectionreason": "Aligns with TPP adaptive development strategy. Supports IND timeline commitment to Series B financing (Q1 2026 submission required). Contingency: Phase I protocol includes hepatic safety monitoring (ALT, AST, bilirubin at multiple timepoints); if safety signal emerges, initiate hepatic metabolite study immediately."
    }
  ],
  
  "evidence": [
    {
      "evidenceid": "E-TPP-001",
      "source": "Target Product Profile (TPP), rev 3.0, approved 2025-09-15",
      "relevantexcerpt": "Phase I adaptive development strategy: Conduct limited hepatic assessment in IND-enabling package (liver histopathology + hepatic clearance study in beagle); reserve specialized hepatic metabolite study for post-IND phase contingent on Phase I safety findings.",
      "completeness": "complete"
    }
  ]
}
```

**TPP replacement value:**  
The decision log explicitly references the Target Product Profile (TPP), ensuring that individual decisions remain aligned with the intended product vision. This prevents scope creep by requiring an explicit rationale when studies are deferred and ensures sufficient preparation by gating decisions against TPP milestones.

**Integration benefit:**  
Team members can see a clear, documented connection between tactical decisions and strategic intent. This reduces rework driven by misaligned assumptions and accelerates decision-making by making the TPP-aligned rationale explicit and reviewable.

#### Integration Pattern 4: Multi-Tiered QA Workflow → Human Review in `aiassistance` Object

**Traditional Multi-Tier QA Practice:**

Regulatory documents typically pass through multiple review stages:

- Author  
- Peer Review  
- QC Specialist  
- Functional Lead  
- Red Team (cross-functional review)

Each stage records who reviewed the document, when the review occurred, and any issues identified, with formal sign-off at each step.

**Problem:**

Once AI tools are introduced into the workflow (e.g., CoAuthor drafting M2.6.7 sections or IQVIA analyzing regulatory precedent), accountability becomes unclear. Key questions emerge:

- Who is responsible for reviewing AI-generated output?
- Does AI content bypass standard QA tiers?
- Do all tiers review AI-generated content, or only designated reviewers?

Without a consistent framework, AI-specific quality control becomes fragmented and inconsistent.

**RGDS Integration:**

The `aiassistance.humanreview` field captures AI-specific quality assurance within the existing QA structure. It documents:

- **Which QA tiers reviewed AI output**
- **What each reviewer found**
- **What corrections or overrides were applied**

This preserves the familiar multi-tier QA workflow while making AI oversight explicit and auditable.

> **Note:** Several JSON code samples are intentionally shown in full without wrapping. On smaller screens, use horizontal scrolling within the code block to view the complete structure.

```json
{
  "aiassistance": {
    "used": true,
    "tool": "CoAuthor (Certara), v3.2",
    "humanreview": [
      {
        "tier": "Author Review (Tier 1)",
        "reviewer": "Senior Medical Writer",
        "reviewdate": "2026-01-10T09:00:00Z",
        "findings": "Reviewed AI-generated M2.6.7 draft (pages 1–45). Cross-referenced 100 factual assertions (dose levels, NOAEL, target organs, histopathology findings) against source GLP reports. Identified 3 sections where AI over-interpreted clinical significance (pages 8–10, 23–25, 38–40). All factual assertions verified as 100% accurate."
      },
      {
        "tier": "Peer Review (Tier 2)",
        "reviewer": "Toxicology SME (external consultant)",
        "reviewdate": "2026-01-11T14:00:00Z",
        "findings": "Validated Senior Medical Writer's findings. Confirmed 100% factual accuracy. Agreed with severity interpretation corrections (liver enzyme elevation not clinically significant; body weight decrease transient and reversible)."
      },
      {
        "tier": "QC Specialist Review (Tier 3)",
        "reviewer": "QC Specialist, Regulatory Operations",
        "reviewdate": "2026-01-12T10:00:00Z",
        "findings": "Reviewed final M2.6.7 (after human corrections applied) for compliance with ICH M4 format, FDA stylistic guidance, nomenclature consistency. Zero critical findings."
      },
      {
        "tier": "Functional Lead Approval (Tier 4)",
        "reviewer": "Medical Writing Director",
        "reviewdate": "2026-01-12T15:00:00Z",
        "findings": "Approved M2.6.7 for IND submission. Confirmed human review process adequate and all AI over-interpretations corrected."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**QA replacement value:**  
`aiassistance.humanreview` serves as the QA documentation for AI-assisted content. Each review tier’s findings are recorded once, eliminating redundant manual logs.

**Integration benefit:**  
FDA inspectors can see exactly which QA tiers reviewed AI-generated content and what each tier identified. This demonstrates regulatory-grade quality control of AI outputs. No special or parallel “AI review process” is added—the same multi-tier QA workflow applies, simply documented within the decision log.

---

#### Integration Pattern 5: Status Meetings + Decision Logs → Eliminate Recurring “Are We Ready?” Debates

**Traditional Status Meeting Practice:**

Weekly status meetings involve functional leads reporting progress. At major phase gates (for example, *“Are we ready for IND submission?”*), debate typically unfolds:

- **CMC Lead:** “Manufacturing characterization is 85% complete. Batch release is at the end of the month. We’re not ready.”
- **Regulatory:** “FDA guidance does not require 100% characterization for Phase I. We can proceed with 85% plus a post-IND backfill commitment.”
- **Clinical:** “A four-week delay to reach 100% means missing the Series B financing milestone. That’s unacceptable.”
- **Finance:** “A delay costs $150K per month in burn. We can’t afford a four-week slip.”
- **Quality:** “If we proceed at 85%, we need documented risk acceptance and a contingency plan.”

The discussion cycles for 2–4 weeks, consuming 15–20 hours of executive time, without a clear framework for resolution. Eventually, a verbal decision is made: *“Proceed with 85% plus post-IND backfill.”* What remains undocumented:

1. Who made the decision  
2. What evidence supported it  
3. What risk was explicitly accepted  
4. What conditions were imposed  

**RGDS Integration:**

Instead of recurring status-meeting debates, a **single decision log** captures the decision once, with required fields enforcing clarity around authority, evidence, risk posture, and conditions.

      "rejected": true,
      "rejectionreason": "Defer option rejected due to Series B financing milestone impact: 4-week delay violates committed IND submission date to Series B investors. Delay risks $50M financing round (valuation renegotiation likely; timeline-sensitive investors may withdraw)."
    },
    {
      "optionid": "OPT-B",
      "optiontext": "Proceed with IND submission at 85% CMC completeness, with post-IND backfill commitment (Option B: Risk-accepting on technical completeness; risk-minimizing on timeline/financing)",
      "selected": true,
      "selectionreason": "Aligns with Series B financing milestone. FDA guidance (21 CFR 312.23) permits Phase I IND with 'adequate information to assess product quality'; 85% manufacturing characterization exceeds minimum threshold.

      "approvaldate": "2026-01-10T17:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Status meeting replacement value:**  
A single decision log replaces 2–4 weeks of recurring status meeting debates. Schema-enforced fields ensure clarity by requiring:  
1. All options to be explicitly documented  
2. The evidence base to be recorded  
3. The chosen risk posture to be articulated  
4. Residual risk and contingency plans to be defined  
5. Conditions and accountable owners to be assigned  

**Integration benefit:**  
Fifteen to twenty hours of executive debate time are saved per major decision. The decision is documented once and retrievable in two minutes. Stakeholders align upfront on risk tolerance, conditions, and contingencies, eliminating re-litigation at subsequent phase gates.

## RGDS Implementation Roadmap: 90-Day Pilot to Full Adoption

Below is a pragmatic roadmap for integrating decision governance into biopharma/biotech workflows without disrupting existing project management practices.

---

### Phase 1: Executive Sponsorship & Pilot Scoping (Weeks 1–2)

**Actions:**

- **CEO/COO directive:**  
  “Decision governance is an organizational priority. The RGDS pilot is mandatory. Success criteria: 33% decision-cycle time compression and zero FDA deficiency letters attributable to poor reconstructability within pilot programs.”

- **Identify pilot programs:**  
  Select 2–3 INDs in active preparation, preferably programs facing FDA inspection risk or investor due diligence where reconstructability ROI is visible.

- **Identify pilot team leads:**  
  Designate a Principal AI Business Analyst or senior regulatory strategist as the decision-governance champion for each pilot program.

- **Establish governance committee:**  
  Weekly steering committee (Program Director, VP Regulatory, VP CMC, VP Clinical, CFO) to track pilot metrics and resolve adoption barriers.

**Deliverables:**

- Written executive directive framing RGDS as decision acceleration, not compliance overhead  
- Pilot program selection (2–3 programs)  
- Governance committee charter and meeting cadence  

**Metrics:**

- Pilot enrollment: 100% (2–3 programs enrolled by end of Week 2)

---

### Phase 2: RGDS Training & Decision Log Template Deployment (Weeks 3–4)

**Actions:**

- **RGDS training:**  
  Four-hour workshop for pilot teams covering:
  - RGDS framework (decisions as primary governance artifacts)
  - JSON schema structure (required vs. optional fields)
  - Decision log authoring workflow (decision owner drafts; approvers review; CI/CD validates)
  - GitHub/Git workflow (version-controlled logs, two-minute retrieval)
  - FDA reconstructability scenarios
  - Integration with existing practices (decision logs replace RACI debates rather than adding overhead)

- **Decision log template deployment:**
  - JSON Schema v2.0 published to GitHub (`github.com/organization/rgds-logs`)
  - Templates for common decision categories:
    - Data Readiness Gate (CMC / nonclinical completeness)
    - Risk Assessment (safety signal evaluation)
    - Study Go / No-Go
    - Manufacturing Strategy
    - Regulatory Pathway
  - GitHub Actions CI/CD configured to validate logs against schema prior to merge

- **Weekly office hours:**  
  Decision-governance SME available 10:00–16:00 for real-time questions and template customization.

**Deliverables:**

- Training materials (slides, case studies, FAQ)
- GitHub repository with schema and templates
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Named decision-governance champions per program

**Metrics:**

- Training completion: 100% of pilot teams (15–20 participants)
- Templates published: 5 decision categories
- Repository active and accessible to all team members

---

### Phase 3: First Pilot Decision Logs (Weeks 5–8)

**Actions:**

- Identify the first five phase-gate decisions per pilot program
- Pilot teams author decision logs using templates; decision owner leads authoring
- Governance committee reviews for:
  - Completeness
  - Evidence clarity
  - Explicit risk posture
  - Actionable conditions
- Iterate through 2–3 feedback cycles per decision
- Measure authoring time (target: 30–60 minutes; expect longer early)
- Capture learnings and schema refinements

**Deliverables:**

- Five approved decision logs per pilot program (15–25 total)
- Lessons-learned documentation
- Refined templates
- Stakeholder feedback survey

**Metrics:**

- Decision log completion: 100%
- Authoring time: 30–90 minutes
- Decision cycle time: baseline 45 days → pilot target 30 days
- Schema validation: 100% compliance
- Stakeholder satisfaction: ≥70% favorable

---

### Phase 4: FDA Reconstructability Validation (Weeks 9–12)

**Actions:**

- Simulate FDA inspection questions, such as:
  - “Why did you proceed with incomplete CMC data?”
  - “How was AI-generated content reviewed?”
  - “What precedent supported deferring a hepatic clearance study?”
- Retrieve decision logs from GitHub and demonstrate two-minute access
- Compare reconstructability time:
  - Traditional: 2–4 weeks
  - RGDS: 2 minutes
- Collect evidence and stakeholder feedback

**Deliverables:**

- 10–15 realistic FDA inspection scenarios
- Retrieved decision logs for each scenario
- Timeline comparison analysis
- Stakeholder testimonials

## In Sum: What This Data Says About Question 3

The central insight is that integrating decision governance into biopharma/biotech workflows is a choice between structured clarity upfront and repeated, unstructured debate downstream. RGDS succeeds because it replaces redundant artifacts—RACI matrices, status reports, risk registers, approval emails—with a single source of truth that satisfies all of those needs without adding friction.

**Realistic conclusion:**  
Piloting RGDS on 2–3 high-visibility programs can eliminate 4–6 weeks of recurring phase-gate debates, reduce re-litigation by 70–80%, and recover 15–20 hours of executive time per decision with minimal added authoring burden.

**Main mechanisms:**  
RACI consolidation, CPM risk-acceptance bridging, TPP evidence linkage, multi-tier QA documentation, and status-meeting replacement.

**Where RGDS helps vs. does not:**  
It improves decision speed, alignment, and defensibility; it does not replace core PM tools or fix weak data or governance.

**Pragmatic next move:**  
Begin with a 3–6-month pilot on 2–3 active programs using simple decision-log templates for the most critical phase gates, supported by light governance oversight and weekly office hours. Success at this scale unlocks confident enterprise rollout.

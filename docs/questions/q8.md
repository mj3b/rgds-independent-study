# Research Question 8

## 8. How should implementation roadmaps balance pilot validation, organizational integration, and thought leadership positioning?

---

### The Implementation Strategy Trilemma

**Organizations implementing RGDS face three competing pressures that appear mutually exclusive:**

1. **Pilot Validation (3–6 months):** Prove decision governance works in controlled setting with 2–3 programs before full rollout. Reduces organizational risk (what if adoption fails?). **But:** Extended pilot delays enterprise benefits and competitive positioning.

2. **Organizational Integration (6–12 months):** Scale decision governance across entire portfolio; integrate into all project management workflows; train all 200+ staff members. Captures enterprise value quickly. **But:** Large-scale change management is complex; high organizational disruption; risk of adoption failure at scale.

3. **Thought Leadership Positioning (12–18 months):** Build external visibility as governance innovator; publish research; speak at conferences; establish RGDS as competitive differentiator and thought leadership asset. Builds brand value and attracts talent/partners. **But:** Requires resources; only valuable if implementation succeeds internally first.

**RGDS Resolution:** These are **not competing priorities** but **three sequential phases** of a **24-month implementation roadmap** that naturally builds from validation → integration → thought leadership.

### The 24-Month RGDS Implementation Roadmap

##### Phase 1: Pilot Validation (Months 1–6)

**Goal:** Prove RGDS works in controlled setting with high-visibility programs. Generate internal case studies and stakeholder testimonials.

**Scope:** 2–3 INDs in active preparation, chosen for high visibility (financing milestones, board interest, FDA scrutiny).

**Activities:**

**Month 1: Kickoff & Governance Setup**
>
> - **Executive sponsorship:** CEO/COO directive: "Decision governance is organizational priority. Pilot success criteria: 33% decision cycle time compression + zero FDA deficiency letters attributable to poor reconstructability."
> - **Pilot team:** Program directors + regulatory leads + CMC leads + clinical staff (12–15 people)
> - **Governance committee:** Weekly steering committee (CEO, CFO, VP Regulatory, VP CMC, Program Directors) to track metrics and resolve barriers
> - **Decision governance champion:** Designate Principal AI Business Analyst or senior regulatory strategist as pilot leader

**Deliverables:**
> 
> - Executive directive (written)
> - Pilot program selection (2–3 programs)
> - Governance committee charter
> - Weekly steering schedule

**Month 2: Training & Infrastructure Setup**
> 
> - **4-hour RGDS training:** Pilot team covers framework, JSON schema, GitHub workflow, FDA reconstructability scenarios
> - **GitHub repository:** Create `github.com/organization/rgds-logs/` with GitHub Enterprise licensing
> - **Decision log templates:** 5 common decision categories (Data Readiness Gate, Risk Assessment, Manufacturing Strategy, Regulatory Pathway, Study Go/No-Go)
> - **CI/CD pipeline:** GitHub Actions configured; JSON Schema validation enforced on all commits

**Deliverables:**
> 
> - Training materials (slides, case studies, FAQ)
> - GitHub repository active + CI/CD pipeline operational
> - Decision log templates deployed
> - Weekly office hours established

**Months 3–5: First Pilot Decision Logs**
> 
> - **Phase gate decisions:** Identify first 5 major decisions per program (15 total across 3 programs)
> - **Pilot team authors decision logs:** Decision owner drafts; approvers review; governance committee provides feedback
> - **Iterate:** 2–3 cycles per decision; refine templates based on learnings
> - **Measure:** Track decision log authoring time (target: 30–60 minutes; expect 60–90 minutes early iterations)
> - **Stakeholder feedback:** Monthly pulse surveys (decision owners, approvers, observers)

**Deliverables:**
> 
> - 15 completed, approved decision logs
> - Decision log authoring guidance (best practices)
> - Template refinements based on pilot feedback
> - Stakeholder feedback summary

**Metrics at Month 3–5:**

> - Authoring time: 60–90 minutes per decision log (expected given learning curve)
> - Stakeholder satisfaction: 70%+ favorable
> - Decision cycle time: Early trend toward 30-day target (data sparse but encouraging)

**Month 6: FDA Reconstructability Validation**
> 
> - **Simulate FDA inspection scenarios:** Governance committee poses FDA inspector questions
> - **Retrieve decision logs:** Pilot teams demonstrate 2-minute retrieval from GitHub with complete context
> - **Measure reconstructability:** Track time from "FDA question" to "complete, documented answer"
> - **Measure confidence:** Qualitative assessment from regulatory team: "Does decision log provide complete, defensible answer?"
> - **Collect evidence:** Document specific scenarios where decision log enabled rapid, confident FDA response

**Deliverables:**
> 
> - FDA reconstructability scenarios (10–15 realistic inspection questions)
> - Decision logs retrieved for each scenario (2-minute retrieval demonstrated)
> - Timeline comparison (traditional vs. RGDS reconstructability)
> - Regulatory team testimonials
> - ROI projection: Estimate $50K–$100K savings per IND from accelerated deficiency response

**End-of-Pilot Metrics (Month 6):**
> 
> - **Decision cycle time:** Baseline 45 days → Pilot 30 days (33% compression target achieved)
> - **Decision quality:** 100% of pilot decision logs rated "complete and defensible" by governance committee
> - **Stakeholder satisfaction:** 80% of pilot team members report "decision process clearer" or "improved alignment"
> - **FDA reconstructability:** 2-minute retrieval demonstrated; regulatory team confident in FDA interaction scenarios
> - **Organizational readiness:** Governance committee consensus: "Pilot successful; ready for enterprise rollout"

**Pilot Success Criteria Checklist:**

```

**Key insights:**

- **Phases overlap:** Thought leadership (Phase 3) begins in Month 12, overlapping with end of integration (Phase 2). This allows continuous external messaging of success without waiting for full enterprise adoption.

- **Governance infrastructure evolves:** Initial simple decision logs (Months 1–6) → Standardized templates (Months 7–12) → Mature schema with advanced features (Months 13–24).

- **Adoption accelerates over time:** Early adoption slow (Months 1–6: 3 programs, 15 decisions), then rapid (Months 7–12: 8–15 programs, 50–100 decisions), then mature (Months 13–24: all programs, 200+ decisions total).

- **ROI realization timeline:**

    - Quick wins (Months 6–12): Operational ROI ($1M–$2M)
  
    - Sustained value (Months 12–18): Regulatory + financial ROI emerges ($2M–$4M total)
  
    - Competitive advantage (Months 18–24): Thought leadership positioning becomes differentiator

### Implementation Risk Mitigation

**Key risks and mitigation strategies:**

(Note: Some tables in this white paper are wider than the page; please scroll horizontally to view all columns.)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pilot adopters resist full rollout** | Medium | High | Executive mandate + clear communication that governance is accelerator, not burden. Pilot success stories. |
| **Enterprise scaling overwhelms teams** | Medium | High | Phased rollout (Wave 1, Wave 2) rather than big-bang. Train-the-trainer model. Change champions per program. |
| **Decision logs become "checkbox exercise"** | Medium | High | Strong governance committee oversight. Quality gates (schema validation) enforce discipline. Monthly quality reviews. |
| **Competing technologies/methodologies** | Low | Medium | Decision governance is complementary, not competing. Integration with existing PM tools (CMC 360, Veeva). |
| **FDA skeptical of "new" decision governance approach** | Low | Medium | Early regulatory engagement. Emphasize decision governance supports FDA's preference for transparent decision-making. Position as industry best practice. |
| **Executive/board doesn't sustain commitment** | Low | High | Quarterly ROI reporting to board. Quick wins in Months 6–12 build momentum. Tie executive bonuses to governance metrics. |
| **Thought leadership fails to generate ROI** | Low | Medium | Measure: Conference attendance, white paper downloads, partnership inquiries. Adjust strategy if low uptake. |
